h2. Comity

This is just a proof of concept implementation, based on my very limited test of "Concordion":http://www.concordion.org, which looks awesome.

By contrast, Comity is a gruesome hack which runs tests inline with report generation, rather than generating static reports offline.

The code was cobbled together quickly on the bus this morning, and debugged a little at lunch.

It's called Comity because that's the nicest word I found when typing Concord into thesaurus.com :-)

Comity is currently meant to work in conjunction with "Minim":https://github.com/andyhd/Minim2 by adding some new template functions. These allow you to do the following:

<pre>
<code>
  <p>
    The name
    <? $exec('$result = splitName(#TEXT)') ?>John Smith<? $endExec() ?>
    should be split into the first name
    <? $assertEquals('$result->firstName') ?>John<? $endAssert() ?>
    and the last name
    <? $assertEquals('$result->lastName') ?>Smith<? $endAssert() ?>.
  </p>
</code>
</pre>

This template, when executed, will display something like this:

bq. The name John Smith should be split into the first name *John* and the last name *Smith*.
