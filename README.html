This is just a proof of concept implementation, based on my very limited test of Concordion (http://www.concordion.org), which looks awesome.
</p><p>
By contrast, Comity is a gruesome hack which runs tests inline with report generation, rather than generating static reports offline.
</p><p>
The code was cobbled together quickly on the bus this morning, and debugged a little at lunch.
</p><p>
It's called Comity because that's the nicest word I found when typing Concord into thesaurus.com :-)
</p><p>
Comity is currently meant to work in conjunction with Minim (https://github.com/andyhd/Minim2) by adding some new template functions. These allow you to do the following:
<pre>
  &lt;p>
    The name
    &lt;? $exec('$result = splitName(#TEXT)') ?>John Smith&lt;? $endExec() ?>
    should be split into the first name
    &lt;? $assertEquals('$result->firstName') ?>John&lt;? $endAssert() ?>
    and the last name
    &lt;? $assertEquals('$result->lastName') ?>Smith<? $endAssert() ?>.
  &lt;/p>
</pre>
